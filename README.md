# Probability and Random Variables Project

## Problem Statement
To analyze student exam marks as a discrete random variable and study its probability distribution using Python.

## Dataset
- Student Exam Marksheet (CSV)
- Contains marks obtained by students

## Methodology
- Defined marks as a discrete random variable
- Calculated PMF, mean, variance, and standard deviation
- Visualized distribution using histogram

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run `probability_assignment.py`

## Output
- Statistical measures
- Histogram of student marks
